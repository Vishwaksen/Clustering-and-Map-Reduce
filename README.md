# Clustering-and-Map-Reduce
Implemented K-means, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, Density-based clustering with Single Link (Min) and MapReduce K-means in order to find clusters of genes that exhibit similar expression profiles on two given datasets.

The Clustering results from different algorithms were validated using an external index(Rand an Jaccard coefficient) and also visualized through Principal Component Analysis(PCA).
